   <p>  <b> Gandhi Memorial Museum </b> established in 1959, is a memorial museum for Mahatma Gandhi located in the city of Madurai in Tamil Nadu, India. Known as Gandhi Museum, it is now one of <i><b> The five Gandhi Sanghralayas (Gandhi Museums)</b></i> in the country.
     It includes a part of the blood-stained garment worn by Gandhi when he was assassinated by Nathuram Godse.
     <br>
     The museum has an original letter written personally by Gandhiji to Narayanan Satsangi of Devakottai. 
     A congratulatory message sent by Gandhiji to freedom fighter and poet Subramania Bharati is also preserved in this museum.
     Another interesting letter is the one written by the Mahatma Gandhi to Adolf Hitler. Located in a quiet place, this memorial of Gandhi contains a "Visual Biography of Bapuji" containing photos, paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, quotations and selected copies of his letters and renderings. 
     This section contains 124 rare photographs depicting various phases of Gandhi from his childhood days until being taken to the crematorium. 
     This section contains 14 original artifacts used by Gandhi. There is a blood-stained cloth used by Gandhi on the day of his assassination, although it is also said that this is only a replica and not the original.
     It is conserved inside a vacuum glass box, making viewers remember the importance of that day in the history of India.
